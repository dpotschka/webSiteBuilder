<br>
<br>I have been living in the lower main land of BC my whole life; Canada is a great place to be I must say. &nbsp;I was a guitar teacher for 18 years, took a couple of years of computer science at SFU and ran a few small businessâ€™ in my time.  Other interests include economics, the stock market, literature and art. &nbsp; For those of you who know me, I have been kicking the can down the road for the past oh um 14 years or so, kind of like the global debt, when will we pay that off lol. &nbsp; Anyway, itâ€™s time for me to get back on the horse again and so I have started yet another business and this is it, my digital marketing company.  
<br>
<br>One of my long-term goals is to start a non-profit charity. &nbsp; In order to do that I need to start a hedge fund, in order to start a hedge fund, I need to earn about $100k in personal cash, so after the website design business acquires some advertising money, I will be launching my ecommerce business. &nbsp; I am telling you all this because perhaps one day you will become an investor in my endeavors. &nbsp; I look forward to hearing from you for any website design work you may require at this time. &nbsp;Oh, and donâ€™t forget to check out my mock portfolio.  I started it at the perfect time lol (Oct 3/18) the day the bear market started. &nbsp;You can download the screen shots of all the trades here. &nbsp;<br>
<br>Thank you for your patience,
<br>
<br>Cheers  ðŸ˜‰
<br>
<br>Dave 
<br>
<br>PS:  
<br>Hopefully I can write those screenplays and start that jazz/rock band in my spare time&nbsp;<br></p>
