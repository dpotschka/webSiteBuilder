                <p class="mbr-text align-center pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong><br>A web page is made up of three things, sounds, images and words.  If you supply me with the sounds, images and the words (text) it costs $400 for a 5 page website.  Each additional page is $40.
<br>If you want me to create the sounds, images and words, the additional costs are as follows:
<br>1.	 Sounds – Not required for most websites.  Prices vary, starting from $50 (for the entire website).
<br>2.	Images – In General FREE. &nbsp;If you request a specific type of &nbsp;image it is $10 per image. &nbsp;Your website may not require any images.
<br>3.	 Words (text) – 50 cents per word.
<br>4.	Logo creation, prices starting from $80.  
<br>5.	Animation is contingent on the complication of the animation, costs vary, prices start from $100.
<br>6.	Original art work.  Contingent on your taste lol. &nbsp; See my portfolio here for a sample of my abilities.
<br>7.	Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is FREE!  This helps Google's search engine find your website.  
<br>
<br>I am a seasoned veteran (56 years old) in the world of computing, communication, marketing/advertising and business.  I know what your web page should look like and the message it should convey dependent on the type of business or message you are trying to send to your clients.  
<br>
<br>In person marketing and business propagation/advice is $300 per hour.  I will however meet with you for a social visit if you like, after a successful transaction between us.  
<br>
<br>There are no upfront fees for building the website!  
<br>I will build the website on my server for FREE.  Then you can tell me if you like it, or if there are any changes you would like me to make**10 changes maximum - If you want me to make more than 10 changes to the website you will have to purchase the website.
<br>  
<br>After you are satisfied with the FREE version of the website you can make a onetime payment and then I will upload the website to your server.  Don’t worry about these server details I will upload the website to your server for FREE.  You are now live, online and it is time to start your advertising campaign!  
<br>
<br>There is NO obligation for you to buy the website at all.  If you decide you don’t want it or decide to go with another website building company that’s fine.
<br>
<br>I am currently NOT handling any marketing strategies or advertising campaigns for clients but may do so in the future. &nbsp;I will let you know.
<br>
<br>A good way to get started is for you to look at your competition’s websites and tell me which one of those is the best. Then I will build you a better one with my vast experience and your competition’s website as the model.
<br>
<br>Cheers,
